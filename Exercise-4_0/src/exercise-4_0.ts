//1. Task: Create an Atm class that allows a user to authenticate, logout, check his/her balance, get money, add money 
//   to their account.  The Atm class should internally use an instance of an Account class and an instance of a Bank
//   class that stores a list of all accounts. 
//   
//   You will use the browser console to test your atm.  You will need to log write console messages using console.log()
//   console.error();
//
//   Instantiate an instance of the atm in the code here so that it is available in your browser console.
