//1. Task: Create an Atm class that allows a user to authenticate, logout, check his/her balance, get money, add money 
//   to their account.  
//
//   You should create an Account class and a Bank class.  
//   The Account class should manage the concerns of the account by knowing the username and password, the current balance, 
//   and adding/removing funds to or from the balance.
//
//   The Bank class should maintain a list of accounts and have one method: getAccount which takes a user name and password
//   and searches returns an account if found.
//
//   Create an account and a bank in your code and instantiate an atm, passing in the bank instance.  Add a public api to 
//   your Atm class to accomplish the above tasks.  
//   Use the browser console to test your atm by instantiate an instance of the atm in the code here so that it is 
//   available in your browser console in the global namespace.
